# galaxy-galaxy-sel
This repository contains programs written for a research project, with the objective of formulating a selection function for [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](https://github.com/DarkEnergySurvey) galaxy-galaxy lens candidates. We do this through statistical comparison of photometric properties between a population of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and a sample of galaxy-scale lenses.

The population of LRGs was randomly selected from the DES Y3 redMaGiC catalog ([Rozo, et al., 2016](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/461/2/1431/2608400)), and the sample of galaxy-scale lenses was selected from a catalog of candidates in DES Y3, presented in [Jacobs, et al. (2019)].
